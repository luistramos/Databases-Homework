2. create table mentors (
	id serial primary key,
	name varchar(30) not null unique,
	years_glasgow int,
	address varchar(60),
	fav_lang_programming varchar(30));
      
3. insert into mentors (name, years_glasgow, address, fav_lang_programming)
	values	('Isard', 4, 'Isard Street 3', 'JavaScript'),

4. create table students (
	id serial primary key,
	name varchar (30)not null unique,
	addres varchar (60),
	graduated_from_Code_Your_Future boolean);

5. insert into students(name, addres, graduated_from_Code_Your_Future)
	values('Luis', 'Avenida Ramos 45', true),

		('Nata', 'Calle Vieja, 5', true);
      
6. select * from mentors;
   select * from students;

7. create table classes (
	id serial primary key,
	mentor_id int references mentors (id),
	tema varchar (30),
	date_class date,
	location varchar (60));

8. insert into classes (mentor_id,tema,date_class,location)
	values (4,'HTML','2022-12-17','Barcelona'),
		(1,'NODEJS','2022-12-13','Barcelona'),
		(5,'REACT','2023-01-10','Barcelona'),
		(2,'DATEBASE','2023-01-14','Barcelona');

9. create table attendance (
  	id serial primary key,
  	student_id int references students (id),
  	class_id int references classes (id));

	insert into attendance (student_id, class_id)
		values (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (7,3), (8,3), (9,4), (10,4);

10. a) Retrieve all the mentors who lived more than 5 years in Glasgow
 		select * from mentors
			where years_glasgow > 5;
	b) - Retrieve all the mentors whose favourite language is Javascript
		select * from mentors
			where fav_lang_programming  = 'JavaScript';
	c) Retrieve all the students who are CYF graduates
		select * from students
			where  graduated_from_Code_Your_Future =true;
	d) Retrieve all the classes taught before June this year
		select * from classes
			where  date_class < '2023-06-01';
 	e) Retrieve all the students (retrieving student ids only is fine) who attended the Javascript class
		(or any other class that you have in the `classes` table).
	 	select * from attendance;
 		
```

When you have finished all of the questions - open a pull request with your answers to the `Databases-Homework` repository.

## Task

1. Create a new database called `cyf_classes` (hint: use `createdb` in the terminal)
2. Create a new table `mentors`, for each mentor we want to save their name, how many years they lived in Glasgow, their address and their favourite programming language.
3. Insert 5 mentors in the `mentors` table (you can make up the data, it doesn't need to be accurate ;-)).
4. Create a new table `students`, for each student we want to save their name, address and if they have graduated from Code Your Future.
5. Insert 10 students in the `students` table.
6. Verify that the data you created for mentors and students are correctly stored in their respective tables (hint: use a `select` SQL statement).
7. Create a new `classes` table to record the following information:

   - A class has a leading mentor
   - A class has a topic (such as Javascript, NodeJS)
   - A class is taught at a specific date and at a specific location

8. Insert a few classes in the `classes` table
9. We now want to store who among the students attends a specific class. How would you store that? Come up with a solution and insert some data if you model this as a new table.
10. Answer the following questions using a `select` SQL statement:
    - Retrieve all the mentors who lived more than 5 years in Glasgow
    - Retrieve all the mentors whose favourite language is Javascript
    - Retrieve all the students who are CYF graduates
    - Retrieve all the classes taught before June this year
    - Retrieve all the students (retrieving student ids only is fine) who attended the Javascript class (or any other class that you have in the `classes` table).
